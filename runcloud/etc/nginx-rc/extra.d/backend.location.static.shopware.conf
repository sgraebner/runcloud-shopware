# Nginx Performance Optimization and Cache Settings
# Author: JUNU Marketing Group LTD

# Description: This configuration block enhances performance 
#              by optimizing cache control, logging behavior,
#              and file handling in Nginx for Shopware 6.
# =========================================================

# Override Cache-Control header to enhance browser caching behavior
add_header Cache-Control "public, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate";
# Explanation:
# - public: Allows caching by any cache (browser, proxy, etc.).
# - must-revalidate: Forces the cache to validate with the server before using the cached copy.
# - proxy-revalidate: Similar to must-revalidate, but specific to shared caches (proxies).

# Additional optimization settings to reduce server load and improve response times
# Disables access logging to minimize disk writes and improve performance
access_log off;
# Suppresses logging of 404 errors to reduce unnecessary log entries
log_not_found off;
# Disables TCP_NODELAY, allowing Nginx to buffer small TCP packets and send them efficiently
tcp_nodelay off;             

# Set the OS file cache to optimize how Nginx handles frequently accessed files
# Caches up to 3000 open files that were inactive for 120 seconds
open_file_cache max=3000 inactive=120s;
# Validates cached items every 45 seconds to ensure consistency
open_file_cache_valid 45s;
# A file must be accessed at least twice in the specified time period to be cached
open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
# Disables error caching, so Nginx does not cache file access errors
open_file_cache_errors off;
# Explanation:
# - These settings optimize how Nginx handles frequently accessed files, reducing disk I/O and speeding up file access.
# - Ideal for high-traffic sites where static content or frequently accessed files benefit from caching in memory.
