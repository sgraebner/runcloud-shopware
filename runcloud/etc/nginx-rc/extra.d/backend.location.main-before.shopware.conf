# =========================================================

# Handle the Shopware Installer PHAR file requests
location /shopware-installer.phar.php {
    # Attempt to serve the request or pass it to the PHAR file for handling
    try_files $uri /shopware-installer.phar.php$is_args$args;
}

# Serve assets under the PHAR context by routing them through the PHAR file
location ~ ^/shopware-installer\.phar\.php/.+\.(?:css|js|png|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ {
    # Attempt to serve the asset, or reroute through the PHAR script
    try_files $uri /shopware-installer.phar.php$is_args$args;
}

# Deny access to hidden files (dotfiles) to prevent unauthorized access
# Excludes ".well-known" for SSL/TLS challenges like Let's Encrypt
location ~ /\. {
    # Denies access to hidden files for security
    deny all; 
    # Suppress logging for denied requests to reduce log noise
    access_log off; 
    # Suppress not found logs for security purposes
    log_not_found off; 
}

# Deny PHP execution in public directories to prevent code execution
# Protects media, thumbnail, theme, bundles, and other public paths
location ~ ^/(media|thumbnail|theme|bundles|sitemap).*\.php$ {
    # Completely deny access to any PHP files in these public paths
    deny all; 
}

# Handle Shopware installation process
# Routes all requests to the installation index.php
location /recovery/install {
    # Default index file for the installation process

        # Suppress not found logs to keep logs clean

    }
    # Rewrite all update requests to the main update index.php
    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        # Redirect all requests to the update index
        rewrite . /recovery/update/index.php last; 
    }
}

# Apply Content-Security-Policy header to SVG files to prevent script execution

}
